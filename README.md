# Speed Test
### Created by Calum McCallion

### Version: v1.0

This Python script performs a speed test to measure download speed, upload speed, and ping. It utilizes the `speedtest` library to connect to the nearest server and retrieve the test results.

To run the speed test, simply execute the script. The script will display a graphical window that shows the progress of the test. It will first load the server list, choose the best server, perform a download test, an upload test, and finally a ping test.

The test results will be displayed on the screen, including the download speed, upload speed, and ping time. Once the test is complete, you can close the window by clicking on it.

Please note that an active internet connection is required for accurate test results.

Feel free to use and modify this script to suit your needs. Happy testing!

**Instructions:**
1. Make sure you have the `graphics` and `speedtest` libraries installed.
2. Execute the script.
3. Observe the progress and test results displayed in the graphical window.
4. Click on the window to close it after the test is complete.

Enjoy!
